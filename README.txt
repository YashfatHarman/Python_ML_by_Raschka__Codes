Codes while going through the awesome book "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka.

I was reading the book chapter by chapter, and at the same time was typing in and
trying out all the codes included in the book. Raschka made all the code
available in GitHub, so people can just download them and run. But I learn
better when I write code myself, so did it this way.
